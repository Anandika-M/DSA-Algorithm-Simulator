      "options": ["O(n)", "O(n log n)", "O(n²)", "O(1)"],
      "answer": "O(n)",
      "explanation": "When the array is already sorted, each insertion only needs one comparison."

      "question": "Why is Insertion Sort considered a stable sorting algorithm?",
      "options": [
        "Because it uses extra space",
        "Because it maintains the relative order of equal elements",
        "Because it divides the array into halves",
        "Because it uses recursion"
      ],
      "answer": "Because it maintains the relative order of equal elements",
      "explanation": "During insertion, equal elements are never swapped, preserving order."

      "question": "Which scenario benefits most from Insertion Sort?",
      "options": [
        "Large random datasets",
        "Nearly sorted datasets",
        "Arrays with many duplicates",
        "Very large unsorted datasets"
      ],
      "answer": "Nearly sorted datasets",
      "explanation": "Insertion sort adapts well when data is already close to sorted, approaching O(n) time."

      "options": ["n", "n-1", "log n", "n²"],
      "answer": "n-1",
      "explanation": "Each element from index 1 to n-1 is considered once for insertion."

      "question": "What happens when Insertion Sort encounters a reverse-sorted array?",
      "options": [
        "It runs in O(n)",
        "It runs in O(n log n)",
        "It runs in O(n²)",
        "It does not terminate"
      ],
      "answer": "It runs in O(n²)",
      "explanation": "Each element must be compared and shifted all the way to the beginning."
