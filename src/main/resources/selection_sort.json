      "content": "Imagine you're organizing a hand of playing cards. You look through all the cards to find the smallest one and place it at the leftmost position. Then you look through the remaining cards to find the next smallest one and place it second from the left. You continue this process, each time scanning through the remaining unsorted cards to find the smallest one and moving it to the end of the sorted section. It's like repeatedly picking the 'best' (smallest) candidate from the remaining options until everything is in order."

      "content": "Selection Sort works by maintaining two subarrays in a given array:\n1. The subarray which is already sorted\n2. The remaining subarray which is unsorted\n\nIn every iteration, the minimum element from the unsorted subarray is selected and swapped with the leftmost element of the unsorted subarray, moving the boundary between sorted and unsorted subarrays one element to the right.\n\n**Key Idea:** Repeatedly find the minimum element and put it at the beginning of the unsorted portion."
